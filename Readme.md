# Building a Spotify API with React

In order to create this project first I usethe build tool [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to initialize the project with React.

NPM Command:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

After that you need to create an account in [Spotify For Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) in order to get the needed client token and client secret token to connect to the API.

With all this you can start to work on your project to create a component that allow you to consume the API from Spotify and get the information from any artist that you query on.
